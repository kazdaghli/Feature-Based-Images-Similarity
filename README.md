# Feature-Based-Images-Similarity
 
For this challenge, a fusion of algorithms for face recognition has led to a dataset of images comparision. This dataset is composed by:

    14 features for image 1
    14 features for image 2
    8 features for the matching scores between image 1 and image 2.

The goal here is to predict whether 2 images are similar or not.
